# Oil Palm Probabilistic Risk Assessment

Notebooks containing the probabilistic risk assessment of chemicals measured in oil palm plantations.

Launch these notebooks interactively on Binder: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/samharrison7/borneo-probabilistic-risk-assessment/HEAD?labpath=notebooks%2Foil-palm-risk-assessment.ipynb)

View the code on Zenodo: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.8307873.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8307873)

Alternatively, download a copy of the notebooks and run on your own machine. Use the [environment.yml](./environment.yml) file to create a Conda environment with the required pacakges:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:samharrison7/borneo-probabilistic-risk-assessment.git
$ cd borneo-probabilistic-risk-assessment
$ conda create -f environment.yml
```

Start up Jupyter Lab, open the [notebooks/old-palm-risk-assessment.ipynb](notebooks/old-palm-risk-assessment.ipynb) notebook and change the kernel to the `borneo` Conda environment you just created.
